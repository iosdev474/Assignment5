PROGRAMS LIST

1.  Write a program Move all zeroes to end of array. 
Input: {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6,  0}
Output: {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}.

2.  Count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k. 
Input: {1, 5, 3, 4, 2},  k=3
Output: 2

3.  Rotate the array by position k. 
Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, k=2 
Output: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1,  2}

4.  Take a 3*3 matrix as key board input. Write a program to calculate sum of upper triangle  matrix.

5.  Write a program to find max and min element of an array of size n which contain both +ve and –ve 
number. Take the array as key board input.  N>5.

6.  You are given an array containing +ve and –ve integers. Write a program to find the subarray 
with the largest sum.

7.  Let X[1………………n] & Y[1……………….n] be two sorted arrays. Write a program to find the median of 
the two merged arrays.

8.  Take a nxn matrix as key board input. Write a program to print a matrix  spirally.

9.  Write a program to find second highest and second lowest number of an array. Take Input from 
key board.

10.  You have to take two 2Dmatrix from user and write a program for multiplication of both  matrix.

11.  You have to take a sentence as key board input and write a program to reverse each word of 
the sentence. 

12.  Write a program for an character array modification in following way. 
Input- my name is bharat
Output- MY NAME IS BHARAT

13.  Write a C program that, given an array A[] of n numbers and another number x, determines 
whether or not there exist two elements in S whose sum is exactly  x.

16 Write a C program which find that any element of array exist more than n/2 times or not if yes 
then print that element else print not exist.

17.  Write a program that find union and intersection of two sorted array which is given by  user.

18.  You have an array of n number from user side. Write a program to calculate mean, standard 
deviation.

19.  You have given a character array which contain a sentence from user side. Write a program to 
count number of words,  alphabets.

20.  You have given two n*n matrix from user side. Write a program to find sum and difference 
matrix.

21.  Write a c program to find the length of string without using strlen()  function.

22.  Insert an Element in a Specified Position in a given Array  .

23.  Print first n prime numbers starting from 2. Where n>20.

24.  Write a program to implement power  function.

25.  Given an array of integers, find the first repeating element in it. We need to find the element 
that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is  smallest.

26.  You are given an unsorted array with both positive and negative elements. You have to find the 
smallest positive number missing from the  array.
Examples
Input: {2, 3, 7, 6, 8, -1, -10,  15} 
Output:  1

27.  You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order. Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right 
side of the array. You are supposed to use only one loop  only.

28.  An array A of an element (n>=3) with distinct +ve integers. Array B with (n*(n-1))/2 elements 
which represent sum of all possible pairs of two numbers of array A. You are just given array B 
and you have to find array  A.

29.  Given an array of positive integers. All numbers occur even number of times except one number 
which occurs odd number of times. Try to solve this question with the use of single loop only.
